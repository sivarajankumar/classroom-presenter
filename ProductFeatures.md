## Features (RC) ##
At the time of our RC we have reorganized the priority of the features as follows:
### Primary ###
  * ~~**Basic Framework** to allow for Courses, Sessions, Instructors and Students to interact.~~  **DONE**
    * ~~This includes, on the instructor side, creating courses and adding students to the course, opening a class session for a course during a class.~~
    * ~~On the student side, it allows students to be able to view courses that they are participating in, join sessions that are active and changing their alias.~~
    * ~~This also includes logging in and logging out for all users.~~

  * ~~**Question/Answer Management:** Incognito manages all of the questions so that the instructor can easily view and mark questions sent in by students. Students can also send in suggestions and other feedback which will be visible to the instructor.~~ **DONE**

  * ~~**Auto-Complete Box:** Groups questions to prevent students from submitting similar questions making the data more manageable.~~ **DONE**

  * ~~**Student and Instructor Surveys:** Incognito allows Instructors to open polls and free response questions for the class. Students can submit their answers anonymously.~~ **DONE**

  * ~~**Timeline graph:** This allows the instructor to monitor the activity of the feed with the least distraction. The timeline will show the activity as a line graph. If there is a huge spike it would indicate to the instructor that the majority of the class is having concerns with the certain part of the lecture.~~ **DONE**

  * ~~**Bug Report** : Allows user to submit bug reports to the devs.~~ **DONE**

  * ~~**Help Page** : Gives users a place to seek help.~~ **DONE**

### Stretch ###

  * **Video Tutorial:** Incognito will include a video tutorial as a complement to its text-based documentation.

  * **Spam Prevention:** Incognito allows instructors to mark certain questions as spam so that users who ask excessive and/or irrelevant questions cannot continue to submit questions.

  * **Quick Questions:** Students can submit quick questions via text message and/or mobile site.

  * **Saved Sessions:** Incognito saves and stores each classroom session and all the data associated. Students can look back at previous lectures to check their questions and review answers. Instructors can reference this data for analysis.

  * **After Class Sessions:** With saved sessions the teacher can answer questions after class and send it to the mailing list.

**Extra Features that would be nice in the future**
  * **Grouping and/or Prioritizing:** This would allow the instructor to group and/or prioritize questions and feedback. For example, the most asked questions would be percolated to the top of the question feed on the instructor’s end. This would allow the instructor to answer the questions that are most common throughout the class during lecture.

  * **Statistics:** Incognito provides statistics on the distribution of questions throughout the lecture so that the instructor can easily identify areas of the presentation that may be confusing to students.

  * **TA Accounts:** Allows for a ta to assist the instructor in adressing questions.
  * **Live Feed/Recording:** This would allow a student to connect remotely to a lecture and view the presentation over a live video feed. Since the instructor will probably be using a laptop during lecture, and most laptops have a microphone and web cam, we can utilize this to stream the lecture through to the application.

  * **Interactive Tutorial:** This feature would supplement the documentation and video tutorial by interactively walking users through using Incognito’s features.
