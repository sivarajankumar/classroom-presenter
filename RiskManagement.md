# Risks from SRS #

**Due to time constraints, the main risk we anticipate is being unable to finish all the work.** Since there are only eight weeks left in the quarter and each member is taking a full class load in addition to personal obligations, it may be difficult to finish all of our project goals. Another possible caveat is the unforeseeable technology barrier. Specifically, there are quite a few technologies that we will have to research in order to develop the project. Most of us have very limited experience with front-end development, and none of us have actually developed a complete website before. However, we hope that our flexible team structure will help to mitigate these risks by allowing us to temporarily reallocate members of the team to areas in need of extra attention.

**Since our project consists of separate front-end and back-end components, integrating these components is another potential issue.** We plan to address this risk by building and integrating a skeleton front-end and back-end early, and then extending each component in parallel. This way, we will test basic interactions between the components early, and will have more time to react if we encounter problems. Our staged delivery project life-cycle will also help us avoid this pitfall. By developing our project as a series of functional releases, we will be less likely to be caught off-guard by integration problems late in the development cycle.

**Finally, we will need to be careful to avoid overextending our development efforts.** If we try to implement a large feature set and run out of time, we could be left with a website that promises much but does not implement its features well. To avoid this, our primary focus is to ensure that the fundamental, in-class aspects of our project are complete and polished before moving on to further features and extensions. This way, our product’s core functionality will not jeopardized.
