# Overview #
We decided to test our application in terms of usability on students mainly and instructors if given the opportunity. We were quite successful in finding willing students and collected a good variety of data. Unfortunately we were not able to find an instructor to test our application with since this week is pretty busy for instructors. We attempted to schedule meetings with Marty Stepp and James Fogarty, but we were not able to arrange these meetings in time for our Release Candidate.

# Tasks #

Scenario #1: You are a student that has just entered class. The lecture has started so you want to join the session and view the feed.

Scenario #2: You are halfway through the lecture. You suddenly have a question that you would like to ask. Submit it through the application.

Scenario #3: The instructor starts writing on the overhead. It is clear to you what is being written. Submit this feedback through the application.

Scenario #4: The instructor decides to create a "clicker question" through the application. Please submit your answer to the question.

Scenario #5: It's the end of the lecture.

# Participants #
  * Ryan: Grad, Designer
  * Andy: Bio, Sophomore
  * Michael: Undecided, Sophomore
  * Johnathan: Math, Sophomore
  * Cleo: Art, Sophomore

# Raw Feedback #
### Students ###
  * Colors are dull
  * Empty (but notes that it is not filled with content yet)
  * Finding access to course related things for the students
  * Nothing happens when you join
  * Color coding answered questions
  * Not complete
  * Needs to be easier to use
    * Clarity (Settings)
  * Dull colors, makes it appear “amateurish” to some extent – apparently overall look could be more professional, but didn’t get specific suggestions on how to improve
  * Wasn’t immediately clear that course management is accessed from settings page – might be better to add another link to main nav bar or something
  * After joining a session, would help to have some indication that it’s now possible to submit questions, etc.
  * Color coding for question/feedback status
  * Clarify UI wording (e.g. feed and such)

  * Seems that they thought it was straight forward
  * Able to navigate
  * Didn't understand the filtering
    * How do we handle spam/abuse
  * Question vs Feedback clear
  * Idea of a session not as clear
    * But not as neccessary
  * Good for small classes
    * Teachers could be overwhelmed
    * Students getting distracted by voting for questions
  * Doesn’t really make sense to vote for a question that’s already answered
  * colors are dull; immature
  * layout → “standard”
  * branding was nothing special
  * observations taken from Ryan’s actions:
  * despite clicking on the feed page multiple times in preparation of the testing, he didn’t read the alert that told him where to navigate in order to open a survey and simple clicked/manually pressed “enter”. This became obvious when the instructor asked him to join a course and he was not able to navigate to the settings page without help
  * thought “Your Settings” was confusing and didn’t convey clearly that one’s courses could be added/quit later. He suggested that “Your Courses” is more explicit and should be separate editing one’s profile

  * after joining a course, he was unsure of what to do next even after suggestions that he should submit a question/feedback. He suggested that there should be some sort of additional explanation (chat box, description next to course line) of what his possible actions could be
  * on the feed page, he thought that the text indicating whether the instructor had “read/answered” something should be color-coded instead; this would remove what he thought was extraneous text

  * straightforward but had question about how long it would take for instructors/students to set up things like surveys
  * not complete, wording on page were a little ambiguous
  * about the group: appeared to be late teens, early twenties
  * thought the website was straightforward
  * did not need much prompting of what/where they should go in order to complete a task; tasks came more naturally than first participant
  * liked: autorefresh, simplicity of website and functionality
  * michael liked the color scheme
  * overall: (Michael) would use Incognito if it was made available, (Cleo) would probably only use it in smaller classes
  * in both tests, despite confusions that arose with the testing, nobody clicked on the help link
